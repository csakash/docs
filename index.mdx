**Welcome!!**

**Have you ever shamelessly taken credit for a super complicated task that AI did on your behalf?**

If you haven't yet, you're probably not keeping up with the AI-powered world we're living in. But no worries we're still in the very early stages of the AI era. If you stay tuned to my daily posts, I'll show you some really cool ways to create your own AI-native workspace and probably end up becoming one of the smartest people in the room.

**What's in it for you?**

Actually, a lot! I believe I have a very effective AI-native workspace that lets me ship products insanely fast and I'm talking about serious products. Building is just one part of it, though. Serious products need a good understanding of the domain, and thanks to AI, anyone can become a domain expert in a day if they find the right resources. So primarily, I'll help you in two major areas:

1. How you can use AI as your thinking partner to become a 10x version of yourself
2. How you can build super cool internal tools and even publish them to the world

**Why should you listen to me?**

Well, I don't come with big company or college tags. But I did found an IoT and AI startup called [Quinch](https://quinch.co.in) in college, then raised **\$125k** to form [Durbin](https://durbin.live) (basically the same company but as a joint venture with the investors). By 2023, it got acquired. I moved to Bangalore (I was in Kolkata previously) and started working as a Senior Machine Learning Engineer at [mirrAR](https://mirrar.com). Later, I also worked with a YC-backed company as a Founding Engineer. So I do have some good and bad experiences and a whole lot of experience self-learning things from scratch.

Currently, I'm working on building [Sudosu](https://trysudosu.com) - an AI workspace for product teams.

Back in 2017, machine learning and deep learning were the hot topics, and me being a statistics nerd studying computer science engineering got introduced to this world where these two get married and live happily ever after. I was SOLD! So from building neural networks from scratch to vibe coding AI agents, I've seen the whole landscape change and built a deep understanding of building AI systems.

**So if you're convinced, let's build, ship, and scale some really cool products together!!**
